module Async
	# A semaphore is used to control access to a common resource in a concurrent system. A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in the real-world systems is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available, coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e. to avoid race conditions) as units are required or become free, and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.
	class Barrier
		def initialize(parent: nil)
			@tasks = []
			
			@parent = parent
		end
		
		# All tasks which have been invoked into the barrier.
		attr :tasks
		
		def size
			@tasks.size
		end
		
		def async(*arguments, parent: (@parent or Task.current), **options, &block)
			task = parent.async(*arguments, **options, &block)
			
			@tasks << task
			
			return task

			@tasks.empty?
